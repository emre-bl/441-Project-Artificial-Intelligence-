As a project for the artificial intelligence course I took in third grade, I completed it. An artificial intelligence (AI) model that follows the user's inputted shopping list and enables them to finish their shopping as fast as possible. Transit times between corridors are retained as a fixed quantity in the most basic market design. The program will nonetheless function the same way even if it is done differently (for example, using a five-story mall instead of a market) and representative constants are added.
